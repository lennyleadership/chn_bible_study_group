Heavenly father, what we are, and yet you are mindful of us, you care for us. You made the Lord Jesus lower than the angels for a little while.  He tasted death on the earth for everyone here and every one in the world, and was crowned with glory and honor by your grace, so that he can bring us to glory.

Heavenly father, you made Lord Jesus as the founder of our salvation. You declared the salvation at first, and God the Father bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to God's will.   

Since we share in flesh and blood, the Lord Jesus also partook of the same thing. Through death the Lord Jesus destroy the devil who has the power of death, and delivered all of us who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
  
  
You made propitiation for our sins


we do not neglect such great a salvation.  
bring us to the glory and join with you.  

inherit salvation

By your grace,
