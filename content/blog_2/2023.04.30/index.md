Heavenly father, what we are, and yet you are mindful of us, you care for us. You made the Lord Jesus lower than the angels for a little while.  He tasted death on the earth for everyone here and every one in the world, and was crowned with glory and honor by your grace, so that he can bring us to glory.

Lord Jesus, you are the founder of our salvation. You declared the salvation at first, and God the Father bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to God's will. 

God the Father, you 

we do not neglect such great a salvation.  
bring us to the glory and join with you.  

inherit salvation

By your grace,
