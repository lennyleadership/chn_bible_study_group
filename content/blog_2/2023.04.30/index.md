Dear heavenly father, today we witnessed the baptism of Trudy Morrison. Not only she has placed her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, but also she was brought into the glory by your mercy [v10]. What a joy we share together! 

These can not be done without the great salvation! Since human beings share in flesh and blood, the Lord Jesus Christ partook of the same things [v14]. Through death the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil who has the power of death, and delivered all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery [v15].  Therefore he had to be made like all those in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people [v17].  

On this special Sunday, As we take the bread, we remember Jesus's sacrifice again. How shall we neglect the marvelous salvation!  Blessed be the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of mercies! We pray in Jesus name!
