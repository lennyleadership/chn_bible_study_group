# Session #1 The death of Anaias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-11

Linda L. shared the fruit of thoughts on the death of Anaias and Sappharia.  She realized that it is a serious issue to deceive God, and that this couple is worse than those who initiated wars.  

Kevin Y.: In the early formation of church, God showed to church that it is important to be pure from beginning, and live holy life and fear the Lord.  

(Psalms 51:1-4) God.
