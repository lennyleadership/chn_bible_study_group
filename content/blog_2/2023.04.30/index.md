Dear heavenly father, what a joy! Not only Trudy Morrison has placed her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, but also she was brought into your glory by your mercy.

All because of such great salvation! How shall we neglect it! Since we share in flesh and blood, the Lord Jesus Christ partook of the same things. Through death the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil who has the power of death, and delivered all of us who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.  Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.  

As we take the bread, we remember Jesus's sacrifice. Blessed be the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of mercies! We pray in Jesus name!
