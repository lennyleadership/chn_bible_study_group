Prayer based on Hebrews 2.
<!--more-->

inherit salvation

Lord, you spoke the salvation at first, and God Father also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed  according to your own will. 

Lord, you were made lower than the angels, you tasted death for everyone here and every one in the world. you were crowned with glory and honor

we do not neglect such great a salvation.  
bring us to the glory and join with you.
