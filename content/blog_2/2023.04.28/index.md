Dear heavenly father, today we witnessed the baptism of Trudy Morrison. Not only she has placed her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, but also she was brought into your glory by your mercy [v10]. What a joy we share together! 

These can not be done without your great salvation! As we share in flesh and blood, the Lord Jesus Christ partook of the same things [v14]. Through his death the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil who had the power of death, and delivered us who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery [v15].  As he made like us in every respect, he might also become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make pro,pi'tiation for our sins [v17].  

On this special Sunday, As we take the bread, we remember Jesus' sacrifice again. How shall we neglect the marvelous salvation!  Blessed be the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of mercies! We pray in Jesus name!
